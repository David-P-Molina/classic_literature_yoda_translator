Classic.create(title: "No Man Is An Island", content: "No man is an island,
    Entire of itself,
    Every man is a piece of the continent,
    A part of the main.
    If a clod be washed away by the sea,
    Europe is the less.
    As well as if a promontory were.
    As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
    Or of thine own were:
    Any man’s death diminishes me,
    Because I am involved in mankind,
    And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
    It tolls for thee.")
    Author.create(name: "Robert Frost", biography: "Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 – January 29, 1963) was an American poet. His work was initially published in England before it was published in the United States. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech,[2] Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early 20th century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.")
    Classic.create(title:"Stopping by Woods On a Snowy Evening", content: "Whose woods these are I think I know.
        His house is in the village though;
        He will not see me stopping here
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.
        My little horse must think it queer
        To stop without a farmhouse near
        Between the woods and frozen lake
        The darkest evening of the year.
        He gives his harness bells a shake
        To ask if there is some mistake.
        The only other sound’s the sweep
        Of easy wind and downy flake.
        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
        But I have promises to keep,
        And miles to go before I sleep,
        And miles to go before I sleep.")

    Classic.create(title:"Still I Rise", content: "You may write me down in history
        With your bitter, twisted lies,
        You may tread me in the very dirt
        But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
        Does my sassiness upset you?
        Why are you beset with gloom?
        ’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
        Pumping in my living room.
        Just like moons and like suns,
        With the certainty of tides,
        Just like hopes springing high,
        Still I’ll rise.
        Did you want to see me broken?
        Bowed head and lowered eyes?
        Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
        Weakened by my soulful cries.
        Does my haughtiness offend you?
        Don’t you take it awful hard
        ’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
        Diggin’ in my own back yard.
        You may shoot me with your words,
        You may cut me with your eyes,
        You may kill me with your hatefulness,
        But still, like air, I’ll rise.
        Does my sexiness upset you?
        Does it come as a surprise
        That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
        At the meeting of my thighs?
        Out of the huts of history’s shame
        I rise
        Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
        I rise
        I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
        Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
        Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
        I rise
        Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
        I rise
        Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
        I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
        I rise
        I rise
        I rise.")
